<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fremont Robotics - About Us</h1>
<p>The Fremont Robotics Team is a student-led organization at Fremont High School that participates in the FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics Competitions. We are dedicated to fostering a passion in science and technology within our community, and making students more aware of applications with science and technology. We run public outreach programs at local schools and compete annually in internationally recognized robotics challenges. By acting as a medium for high school students to explore possible careers in engineering and science, we are able to have a significant impact on our school as well as the community.
</p><p>
The Fremont Robotics Team (FRT) was founded in 2010 by a group of 13 Fremont High students and is successfully starting its third year. For the competitions, the robot is completely designed, prototyped, tested, and programmed by students. FRT values student leadership, initiative, teamwork, and respect within the team as well as among the local FIRST teams. Our team is efficiently organized into separate branches with student leaders and officers who direct individual projects, all working to meet our common goal.

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class = "title_text">What is FIRST?</span></h3>
<p>
For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST) was founded in 1989 by Dean Kamen in order to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers by instilling interest in the fields of science and technology while building self-confidence, leadership, and life skills.
</p>
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class = "title_text">What is the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)?</span></h3>
<p>
The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is a team-based technology event for high school students to provide a hands-on experience in engineering, scientific, finance and management challenges. The program's highlights include:
<ul>
<li>Construction of 5' tall, 120 lb. robots that are designed and built completely by students</li>
<li>Integration of mechanical, electrical, and software elements</li>
<li>Integration of mechanical, electrical, and software elements</li>
<li>Time constraint of six weeks to build and ship the robot to competition</li>
<li>Fundraising to support team activities</li>
<li>Overall team organization and management</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
With the guidance from professionals across various disciplines, students tackle these various tasks. However, at its core, FRC relies on students to efficiently organize themselves as a team. Working much like a hi-tech start-up company, an experience that a traditional robotics or engineering course cannot provide.
